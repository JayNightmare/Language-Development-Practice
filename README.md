    <h1>Language Design CI6115</h1>
</div>

This repository contains coursework for the CI6115 module, focusing on language design and implementation. The coursework is divided into multiple questions, each addressing specific aspects of the module's objectives. Below is an overview of the repository structure and its contents:

## Repository Structure

### Q1
- **Question1.docx**: Documentation for Question 1.

Question 1 [10 marks]
Provide evidence to show that you followed the early workshops and managed to
successfully set up an environment suitable for using ANTLR.
Create a Word document and make sure the document contains headings, external links, screenshots, code samples, and other media (if needed) to show:
- the various steps that you followed in setting up your DYOPL environment, [4 marks]
- how you tested the ANTLR installation, [1 mark]
- how you parsed a simple script of a toy language, [1 mark]
- how you used ANTLR to translate the simple script into Python, [1 mark]
- your thoughts and reflections on this experience. [3 marks]
 
Show evidence through screenshots to show that the actions expected from the script did occur.

Guideline length: aim for five pages; eight pages is too long.

### Q2
- **Question2.docx**: Documentation for Question 2.

Question 2 [12 marks]
In the lectures and workshops, we saw how to add to fspow capability the ability to do logical combinations of filters. Bring together all the efforts explained during teaching to let fspow support complex filter combinations. E.g., this snippet of code should work.
 
```
allFiles = FileCollection("directory")
complexFiles = Selector(name("*.mp4") intersect (not (size("> 300M") intersect date(">1year"))))
allFiles.apply(complexFiles)
```
 
You will need to define all the appropriate grammar changes and write the appropriate instructions in Python to execute the scripts.
 
Marking criteria:
- correctness of syntax enhancements, [3 marks]
- evidence of testing the syntax enhancements, [2 marks]
- translation into Python, [3 marks]
- extensive testing of fspow scripts. [4 marks]

### Q3
- Similar structure to Q2, containing files for another question in the coursework.
Question 3 [12 marks]
Extend fspow to give it the ability to provide the "top 10" of a file-collection. Two options should be available: top 10 by size, top 10 by modification date. E.g., this snippet
of code should work.
```
    sel = Selector(top(10, Biggest))
    topBiggest = fc.apply(sel)
    sel = Selector(top(20, Oldest))
    topOldest = fc.apply(sel)
```
 
The selector "top" should have two parameters:
- number: a literal number that represents the number of elements to return. E.g., 10.
- attribute: a keyword to represent an option.
  - Biggest would indicate top files by size, in decreasing order
  - Oldest  would  indicate  top  files  by  modification  date,  from  the  oldest  to more recent ones
  - Smallest would indicate top files by increasing size, from the smallest to bigger ones
  - Newest  would  indicate  top  files  by  modification  date,  from  the  newest modification date to older ones.
 
You will need to define the appropriate syntax for this syntax extension and write the
appropriate instructions in Python to execute the scripts.
 
Marking criteria:
- correctness of syntax enhancements, [3 marks]
- evidence of testing the syntax enhancements, [2 marks]
- translation into Python, [4 marks]
- extensive testing of fspow scripts. [3 marks]

### Q4
- Placeholder for Question 4 files and documentation.
Question 4 [16 marks]
Consider the mixed-styles notation of fspow. It is neither an object-orientated language nor is it a procedural language purely. The language designers used a mishmash of notational styles. In answering the questions below, make sure to show the originality and authorship of the answer. Think of ways for your answers to be ungeneric and unlike material generated by AI.

Answer the following questions:

- Q6.1. What in your opinion are the potential features and benefits of fspow versus
existing languages and/or solutions? [3 marks]
- Q6.2. Suggest ways of tweaking the syntax of fspow to make it a more object-oriented language. You may suggest tweaks to the syntax, justify why they are more in line with OOP style and discuss how much this would affect the complexity of translating fspow code. Do not write the grammar, just show what the ‘improved’ fspow code would look like and discuss as requested above. [6 marks]
- Q6.3. A computer languages expert suggested that the target language for fspow should be Java because it is cross-platform. Evaluate the suggestion and provide your opinion on whether Java would be a suitable target language for fspow, based on the new language’s features and proposed use cases. [3 marks]
- Q6.4. What are your recommendations for a development roadmap for this new language? [4 marks]

### context
- **CI6115_TB2_Coursework_Brief.pdf**: Coursework brief and guidelines.
- Lecture notes and additional resources.

### Workshops
- Contains materials and exercises from workshops conducted during the module.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective question folder (e.g., `Q1`) to find the relevant files.
    - Commands:
        - To generate Antlr files: `antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 fspow.g4`
        - To generate Grun files: `javac fspow*.java`
    - If commands are not working, review Q1 doc to resolv
2. Use `main.py` in each question folder to execute the language processing tasks.
    - Commands:
        - To see Tree output via Grun: `grun fspow prog -gui <input file name>`
        - For console print: `python main.py <input file name>`
3. Refer to the `README.md` files in each folder for specific instructions and details.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- ANTLR (for grammar processing)
